# ceers-2112 Testnet

Ceers-2112 is the galaxy that most resembles the Milky Way. It is a barred spiral galaxy discovered by the James Webb
Space Telescope. Ceers-2112 is the most distant galaxy of its kind ever observed, and its discovery challenges theories
about how galaxies evolve.

To set up a validator node for this network, please
follow [the guide on our website](https://docs.milkyway.zone/modular-restaking/guides/consensus/validator-node).

âš  **This is a POA testnet** âš 

Since we wanted to mimic the mainnet as closes as possible, we decided to launch the ceers-2112 testnet as a POA
network. This means that the only way you can obtain 1 MILK token that can be self-delegated to join the consensus of
the chain, is by asking our team. To give it to you, we will need an account address with which we will create a vesting
account containing such token. Once that is done, you will be able to self-delegate it to the validator you will be
running.
